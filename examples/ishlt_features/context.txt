FINAL DIAGNOSIS: A-B) Right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy:
- Focal moderate cellular rejection, ISHLT Grade 2 (see comment).
- Immunopathologic but not histopathologic features suggestive of antibody-mediated rejection, pAMR 1(I+).
COMMENT: The biopsy shows immunopathologic features that are suggestive of antibody-mediated rejection.
CLINICAL DATA: Post heart transplant, rule-out rejection.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: A) Examination of sections from all submitted material reveals parts of up to approximately four pieces of endomyocardium.  Within the endomyocardium, there are patchy mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrates which expand the interstitium.  Focally, the inflammation overruns cardiomyocytes and is associated with apparent myocyte necrosis.  The endothelial cells show some reactivity within the small vessels in areas of interstitial inflammation.  The uninvolved portions of the sample show no specific endothelial reactivity within capillaries or intraluminal mononuclear inflammatory cells.  Viral cytopathic effect is not identified.

IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY:  B) Examination of frozen sections from all of the submitted material reveals a single piece of endomyocardium.  Indirect immunofluorescence staining for C4d shows some diffuse and weakly positive staining of the microvasculature.  Indirect immunofluorescence staining for C3d shows focal weak microvascular staining.  Arterial vessels also stain positive for C3d.  All controls were appropriately positive.
