This should be called even if histology suggests that pAMR is positive or negative, or a pAMR score is given. \n0: Negative for pathologic AMR; both histologic and immunopathologic studies are negative.\n1(H+): Histopathologic AMR alone. Histologic findings present but immunopathologic findings positive. \n1(I+): Immunopathologic AMR alone. Histologic findings negative, and immunopathologic findings positive. \n2: Pathologic AMR: Both histologic and immunopathologic findings positive. \n3: Severe pathologic AMR. This category recognizes the rare cases of severe AMR with histopathologic findings of interstitial hemorrhage, capillary fragmentation, mixed inflammatory infiltrates, endothelial cell pyknosis, and/or karyorrhexis and marked edema. The reported experience of the group was that these cases are associated with profound hemodynamic dysfunction and poor clinical outcomes. \n\nNote, if no immunopathology evaluation was performed then pAMR should be returned as NP. This should be done even if the histologic results suggested pAMR is 0.  E.g., the statement 'there are no histopathologic features to suggest antibody-mediated rejection' should still be called as pAMR = NP, unless another sentence directly means immunohistologic evidence, or that immunofluorescence was performed",
